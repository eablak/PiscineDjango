        <li>Follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle</li>
        <li>Includes built-in admin interface</li>
        <li>Highly secure and scalable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Brief History</h2>

    <p>Django was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while working at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper. It was released as an open-source project in 2005. Named after jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, the framework quickly gained popularity thanks to its simplicity, rich features, and excellent documentation.</p>

    <p>Today, Django powers many high-traffic websites and is maintained by an active community of contributors.</p>
